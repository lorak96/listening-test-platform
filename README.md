# listening-test-platform
The designed platform was created using web languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), thanks to which it can be run on many web browsers. 
The structure of the code has been written in such a way that the platform can be easily expanded in the future. The test configuration 
is done easily by changing the code. Interface support as well as test configuration is intuitive and simple. The platform allows you to 
perform tests based on two popular methods: AB and ABX. The results obtained are saved to the .txt file in such a way that they can be 
easily transferred to analytical software. Designing the platform were based on the requirements of ITU-R BS.1116-3 and ITU-R BS.1534-3. 
Among them there is, for example, a 1-second break between the samples being played.
